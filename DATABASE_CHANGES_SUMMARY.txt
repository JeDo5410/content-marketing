Date: November 17, 2025
Prepared for: Content Marketing Team

This document outlines the database changes required to update terminology
from "Solution Sales Canvas" to "Solution Marketing Canvas" and from
"Sub Solution" to "Product".

================================================================================
CHANGE #1: SOLUTION SALES CANVAS → SOLUTION MARKETING CANVAS
================================================================================

What's changing: All references to "SSC" will be changed to "SMC"

TABLES (8 tables affected):
  - ssc_main                           → smc_main
  - ssc_channels                       → smc_channels
  - ssc_funnel_mapping                 → smc_funnel_mapping
  - ssc_personas                       → smc_personas
  - ssc_problem_statements             → smc_problem_statements
  - ssc_solution_features              → smc_solution_features
  - ssc_unfair_advantage               → smc_unfair_advantage
  - ssc_unique_value_proposition       → smc_unique_value_proposition

COLUMN NAMES (12 columns affected):
  - smc_main.ssc_id                    → smc_id
  - smc_main.ssc_url                   → smc_url
  - smc_channels.ssc_id                → smc_id
  - smc_funnel_mapping.ssc_id          → smc_id
  - smc_personas.ssc_id                → smc_id
  - smc_problem_statements.ssc_id      → smc_id
  - smc_solution_features.ssc_id       → smc_id
  - smc_unfair_advantage.ssc_id        → smc_id
  - smc_unique_value_proposition.ssc_id → smc_id
  - content_asset_builder.ssc_id       → smc_id
  - content_topic.ssc_id               → smc_id
  - cta.ssc_id                         → smc_id

RELATIONSHIPS (12 foreign keys affected):
  All foreign key relationships will be recreated with new SMC naming.

IMPACT:
  ✓ Data will NOT be lost - only names are changing
  ✓ All relationships will remain intact
  ✓ Transaction is wrapped - if anything fails, everything rolls back

================================================================================
CHANGE #2: SUB SOLUTION → PRODUCT
================================================================================

What's changing: All references to "Sub Solution" will be changed to "Product"

TABLES (1 table affected):
  - contentmarketing_sub_solutions_master → contentmarketing_product_master

COLUMN NAMES (4 columns affected):
  - contentmarketing_product_master.sub_solution_id   → product_id
  - contentmarketing_product_master.sub_solution_name → product_name
  - contentmarketing_product_master.sub_solution_code → product_code
  - smc_main.sub_solution_id                          → product_id

RELATIONSHIPS (1 foreign key affected):
  The relationship between products and solutions will be recreated.

IMPACT:
  ✓ Data will NOT be lost - only names are changing
  ✓ All relationships will remain intact
  ✓ Transaction is wrapped - if anything fails, everything rolls back

================================================================================
EXECUTION PLAN
================================================================================

1. BACKUP DATABASE
   - Create a full backup of the production database before running scripts

2. RUN MIGRATION SCRIPTS (in order):
   a) migration_ssc_to_smc.sql
      - Changes SSC to SMC
      - Estimated time: 1-2 minutes

   b) migration_subsolution_to_product.sql
      - Changes Sub Solution to Product
      - Estimated time: < 1 minute

3. VERIFY CHANGES
   - Both scripts include verification queries at the end
   - Check that all old references are gone
   - Check that all new names are present

================================================================================
SAFETY FEATURES
================================================================================

✓ Both scripts are transaction-wrapped
  → If any step fails, ALL changes are automatically rolled back

✓ Scripts tested on test database (test_ssctosmc)
  → All changes verified successful

✓ Error handling included
  → Clear error messages if something goes wrong

✓ No data modification
  → Only table names, column names, and constraints are changed
  → Your actual data (rows) remains untouched

================================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO UPDATE AFTER MIGRATION
================================================================================

After running these scripts, the following items may need updates:

1. APPLICATION CODE
   - Update any queries referencing old table names (ssc_*, sub_solution_*)
   - Update column names in INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT statements

2. STORED PROCEDURES / VIEWS (if any)
   - Check for references to old names
   - Update as needed

3. API ENDPOINTS / BACKEND CODE
   - Update model/entity names
   - Update API responses that reference these terms

4. FRONTEND / UI
   - Update labels from "Solution Sales Canvas" to "Solution Marketing Canvas"
   - Update labels from "Sub Solution" to "Product"

5. DOCUMENTATION
   - Update technical documentation
   - Update user guides
